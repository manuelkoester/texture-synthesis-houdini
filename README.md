</details>


2. Add texture-synthesis-houdini to your Houdini Environment

   - Create a folder called **packages** in your Houdini preferences folder (in your home dir)
   - Copy the [**texture-synthesis-houdini.json**](https://github.com/fatboYY/texture-synthesis-houdini/blob/main/texture-synthesis-houdini.json) file into the **packages** folder
   - Edit the json file to point to the extracted **texture_synthesis_houdini** folder (edit the path in the "texture_synthesis_houdini" line)
   - Optional: If you have the texture-synthesis executable in a different place, you can point the **texture_synthesis_executable** to the path of that executable.

To read more on configuration, see the [documentation on Packages](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/plugins.html) on the official SideFX help.

## Getting Started

I reccommend taking a look at the example hipfile I've included at [texture_synthesis_houdini/hip/texture-synthesis_examples_01.hip](https://github.com/fatboYY/texture-synthesis-houdini/blob/main/texture-synthesis_examples_01.hip).  
Make sure you either cloned the repository with its submodules (see Installation step 1) or additionally downloaded and extracted the texture-synthesis source into texture-synthesis-houdini.
